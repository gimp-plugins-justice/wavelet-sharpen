TRANSLATIONS
============

If you want to contribute by translating the program to any language, go to
the 'po' directory and open the file 'Makefile'. Add your language to

	LANGUAGES = de ru it pl et <your language>

with a valid locale name. Then state

	make update-po

which will create the file '<your language>.po'

Translate this file and send '<your language>.po' to the program maintainer.
This would be <marco.rossini@gmx.net>. Thank you!
